## Description
This project is based on making a simple application that helps to keep a track of our daily tasks. It is really easy to use and easy to manage. It is used for simple home lists or to manage complex multi-user projects for business. In addition to tracking the status of tasks. you just have to type in your daily task and checkit out as you complete it so you can keep track of your tasks.

## How to Install
First the user need to download the zip file from the repository and extract it to your folder or to the application in android studio. The user an either use a personal physical device or a virtual device to run the code. I have used constraint layout design pattern and recycleview.

##### Troubleshooting tips
If there is an error in the MainActivity.kt, then make sure to check if you have the following files installed in your android studion in your SDK manager: Android S preview,
                                                                                                                                                            Android 11.0(R),
                                                                                                                                                            Android 10.0(Q).

## Features
It does not have much features right now, but it does have a add and delete button and whenever you want to add any list you can easily add it and whenever you are done with the list you just have to checkmark on the small box on the right in front of the task and delete the task. so it is really easy to keep track of your daily tasks.
